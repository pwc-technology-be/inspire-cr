=== Logical consistency - Conceptual consistency

The Application Schema conformance class of the Abstract Test Suite in Annex I defines a number of tests to evaluate the conceptual consistency (tests A.1.1-A.1.9) of a data set.

=== Logical consistency - Topological consistency

[PERMISSION, id="Recommendation {counter:rec-id}"]

|Data quality basic measure
|Error count

|Definition
|Number of faulty point-curve connections in the dataset.

|Description
|A point-curve connection exists where different curves touch. These curves have an intrinsic topological relationship that has to reflect the true constellation. If the point-curve connection contradicts the universe of discourse, the point-curve connection is faulty with respect to this data quality measure. The data quality measure counts the number of errors of this kind.

Absolute or external accuracy should be evaluated and documented using Mean value of positional uncertainties, as specified in the tables below.

|Data quality element
|Positional accuracy

|Data quality sub-element
|Absolute or external accuracy

|Data quality basic measure
|Not applicable

|Definition
|Mean value of the positional uncertainties for a set of positions where the positional uncertainties are defined as the distance between a measured position and what is considered as the corresponding true position.

|Description
|For a number of points (N), the measured positions are given as xmi, and ymi coordinates depending on the dimension in which the position of the point is measured. A corresponding set of coordinates, xti and yti are considered to represent the true positions. The errors are calculated as

include::../images/tg-au-images.adoc[tags=tg-au-calculationOne]

The mean positional uncertainties of the horizontal absolute or external positions are then calculated as

include::../images/tg-au-images.adoc[tags=tg-au-calculationTwo]

A criterion for the establishing of correspondence should also be stated (e.g. allowing for correspondence to the closest position, correspondence on vertices or along lines). The criterion/criteria for finding the corresponding points shall be reported with the data quality evaluation result.
This data quality measure is different from the standard deviation.
