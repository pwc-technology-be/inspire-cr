= Annex B (informative) Use Cases

This annex describes the use cases that were used as a basis for the development of this data specification.

One of the main uses of administrative units, as described below in B.1 and B.2 is to discover the authorities responsible and competent for the particular area or object in a particular situation. Such authorities may deal with public administration, emergency rescue, health care, nature protection, statistical, building, utility, financial, insurance, and other services. In any e-Government application and any ‘real-life’ situation administrative units are the key to get relevant solution for public authorities, citizens, entrepreneurs, and the services themselves. Therefore, fast discovery of relevant authorities and service providers together with their contact information is indispensable for effective functioning of economy and administration.

== B1 Filtering data

.Use Case Description
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===

| *Name* | *Filtering or selecting data using an administrative unit.*

|Goal
|Retrieving data from other themes corresponding to the geographical scope of one or several administrative units and display this data. 

|Importance
|High

|Description
|This use case includes filtering (selecting) geographic information with respect to administrative unit. User selects regions by clicking or enters a name (or code) to highlight unit and display data for this unit. The geometry of administrative units is used to create filter expressions for retrieving data from other themes. Such filtering should be possible not only for one, but for multiple administrative units. 

|Pre-condition

|- Established system for public administration of administrative units within the MS; +
- Map database (interface for selection); +
- Gazetteer or web map services that provides administrative data.

|Infrastructural aspects
|In this use-case administrative units support (web) map clients in selecting administrative units, download service (for retrieving data), and view service (for viewing data).

|Examples of use

|- Geoportals of the MS; +
- INSPIRE Geoportal.

|Data requirements
|(Explicitly expressed in the use case) +
- standards compliance +
- portability

== B2 Discovery of unit related data

.Use Case Description
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Name* | *Discovery of data sets corresponding to an specific administrative unit. *

|Goal
|Discover available data sets by making catalogue queries using the geographical scope of one or several administrative units, obtaining a list of resources.

|Importance
|High

|Description
|This use-case includes searching catalogues to discover available data sets with respect to administrative unit geometry or name (or code). The geometry of administrative unit is used to create filter expressions for catalogue query. The output of this use-case is a list of resources. 

|Pre-condition
|The use-case can be implemented only in case of: +
- Established system for public administration of administrative units within the MS; +
- Existing map database (interface for selection); +
- Existing gazetteer or web map services that provides administrative data; +
- Existing catalogue services. 

|Infrastructural aspects
|In this use-case administrative units support catalogue clients (for selection of administrative units), and also make part of the catalogue service for retrieving metadata.

|Examples of use
|- Catalogue clients; +
- Catalogue service.

|Data requirements
|(Explicitly expressed in the use case) +
- Geometry of administrative units; +
- Codes of administrative units; +
- Names of administrative units.

== B3 Linking thematic information

.Use Case Description
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Name* | *Linking thematic information to its corresponding administrative unit. *

|Goal
|Present thematic results by administrative unit area. 

|Importance
|High

|Description
|In frame of this use-case a specific user provides/publishes comparable thematic information to other users with an easy and rapid way by linking the thematic information to the administrative units. For this some attributes of administrative units, usually codes are used to link the thematic data.

|Infrastructural aspects
|Using administrative unites as spatial objects for referencing contribute to the consistency of information within the infrastructure. An attribute of administrative unit is used to link other thematic data from the source database that may be managed by an organisation of a different sector.

|Examples of use
|- Statistical/sociological data is often presented according administrative units.

|Data requirements
|(Explicitly expressed in the use case) +
- Geometry of administrative units; +
- Name; +
- Code (for linking).
|===

== B4 Disaster and environmental management

.Use Case Description
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Name* | *Disaster and environmental management by administrative unit area .*

|Goal
|Select administrative units affected by environmental phenomena or disaster. 

|Importance
|High

|Description
|The purpose of this use-case is to select administrative units affected by environmental phenomena or disaster. 

|Infrastructural aspects
|This use-case requires functioning download service (for retrieving administrative unit data), and GIS-application to compute the intersections and display the affected administrative units. As such, demonstrate the collaboration of different components of SDI.

|Examples of use
|- Handling a complaint submitted to the European Commission in context of Natura 2000 – identification of the administrative unit concerned to be able to determine the competent authority in the next steps.

|Data requirements
|(Explicitly expressed in the use case) +
- Geometry of administrative units (for spatial computing the intersection.
|===

== B5 Boundary based analysis

.Use Case Description
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|Name
|Analysis of cross-border features based on administrative boundaries. 

|Goal
|Check and correct edge-matching of features in cross-border areas /  Analyse properties relevant to the environment at both sides of a boundary. 

|Importance
|High / Medium

|Description
|There are two main aspects of this use-case. Firstly the boundaries of administrative units can be used for verification of data of thematic features located at the boundaries of administrative units, which covers checking the semantic classification of the objects as well as their edge-matching.
On the other hand administrative boundaries may become the limit for rights, duties, and/or restrictions of any kind, which is especially relevant to environment. 

|Infrastructural aspects
|Improving cross-border consistency as required in Art 8(2) of the Directive.


|Examples of use
|- Matching cross border linear objects (elements of hydrographic and transport networks).

|Data requirements
|(Explicitly expressed in the use case) +
- Geometry (boundaries) of administrative units; +
- Spatial data of analogous themes coming from different sources; +
- Semantic information (attributes including geographical names) that help selecting identical data; +
- Possibility to link rights to the spatial objects of administrative units.
